# Script Name:                  Uptime Sensor Tool Part 2 of 2
# Author:                       NATASHA SIRAMARCO
# Date of latest revision:      07/12/2023
# Purpose:                      In Python, add the below features to your uptime sensor tool.
#                               
#                               The script must:
#                               
#                               Ask the user for an email address and password to use for sending notifications.
#                               Send an email to the administrator if a host status changes (from “up” to “down” or “down” to “up”).
#                               Clearly indicate in the message which host status changed, the status before and after, and a timestamp of the event.
#                               Important Notes
#                               
#                               DO NOT commit your email password in plain text within your script to GitHub as this easily becomes public.
#                               Create a new “burner” account for this exercise. Do not use an existing email account.
