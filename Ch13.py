# Purpose:                      The final iteration of your network scanning tool will perform the following:
#                               
#                               Ping an IP address determined by the user.
#                                   If the host exists, scan its ports and determine if any are open.
#                                   In Python, combine the two modes (port and ping) of your network scanner script.
#                                   Eliminate the choice of mode selection.
#                                   Continue to prompt the user for an IP address to target.
#                                   Move port scan to its own function.
#                                   Call the port scan function if the host is responsive to ICMP echo requests.
#                                   Print the output to the screen.
